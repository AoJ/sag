Sag is a simple PHP library for working with CouchDB. It is designed to not
force any particular programming method on its users: you just pass PHP objects
to whatever function you want to use and get StdClass objects and Exceptions
back. This makes it trivial to incorporate Sag into your application.

Error Handling
--------------

Sag's paradigm of simplicity is carried into its error handling by allowing you
to send data to CouchDB that will result in errors (ex., malformed JSON). The
reason for this is simple: CouchDB knows when there's an error better than Sag,
and it would be disingenuous for Sag to try and detect errors for CouchDB.
Therefore, Sag will only look for interface problems and issues that are native
to PHP (ex., passing an int instead of a StdClass).

All errors are floated back to your application with the standard PHP
Exception class. Sag does not catch any errors, allowing your application to
care about them or not.

Networking
----------

Sag uses sockets, so there is no dependency on other libraries such as cURL. If
you want to monitor your application's activity on the server side (ex., if you
are proxying requests to CouchDB through a web server), then look for the
User-Agent header.

Results
-------

Results from CouchDB are stored in an object, breaking out the HTTP header
lines and data. For example, running `print_r($sag->get('/1'));` (where '/1' is
the location of a document) would give you something like:

``
stdClass Object
(
    [headers] => stdClass Object
        (
            [_HTTP] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [raw] => HTTP/1.0 200 OK
                    [version] => 1.0
                    [status] => 200
                )

            [Server] =>  CouchDB/0.10.0 (Erlang OTP/R13B)
            [Etag] =>  "1-4c6114c65e295552ab1019e2b046b10e"
            [Date] =>  Mon, 12 Apr 2010 23:01:39 GMT
            [Content-Type] =>  text/plain;charset=utf-8
            [Content-Length] =>  68
            [Cache-Control] =>  must-revalidate
        )

    [body] => stdClass Object
        (
            [_id] => 1
            [_rev] => 1-4c6114c65e295552ab1019e2b046b10e
            [foo] => bar
        )

)
''

This same basic structure is used for all responses: the data returned from
CouchDB is in the $body property, and the HTTP header and protocol info is in
the $headers property.

Functions
---------

FUNCTION                                        DESCRIPTION

Sag($host = "127.0.0.1", $port = "5984")        Specify the address and port in
                                                the constructor.

login($user, $pass, $type = Sag::$AUTH_BASIC)   Set the username and password to
                                                use for all subsequent 
                                                transactions to the server
                                                (null them out to "logout").

decode($bool)                                   Whether or not to decode the 
                                                JSON from CouchDB with PHP's
                                                json_decode().

get($url)                                       Get the specified URL. Ex.,
                                                get("/1") gets a doc with an
                                                _id of 1.

delete($id, $rev)                               Delete a document.

put($id, $data)                                 PUT's a document - $data will
                                                need a $_rev property.

post($data)                                     POST's a document.

createDatabase($name)                           Creates the database.

deleteDatabase($name)                           Deletes the database.

setDatabase($name)                              Specifies which database to
                                                work with.

getAllDocs($includeDocs = false,                Runs /_all_docs with the
            $limit = null,                      provided parameters.
            $startKey = null,
